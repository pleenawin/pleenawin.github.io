		<h1>The usual questions</h1>
		<h3>I’m sorry, what was your name? Helena?</h3>
		<p>Hey there! You know, for some reason, people often think I say “Helena,” but my name is Paulina. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

		<h3>Where are you from, and how’d you end up in California?</h3>
		<p>I’m from Louisiana, which is quite different from California as you can imagine. California was last on my list of places to move to, but I ended up moving here because 1) I wanted to challenge myself and 2) I had a better shot at working in the tech industry. </p>

		<h3>So are you in the tech industry now? If so, what do you do?</h3>
		<p>I started out as a graphic designer when I first moved to California, but now I focus on designing user interfaces (UI). I enjoy working closely with other disciplines because what I learn from them makes me a better designer/employee/teammate. I also help maintain brand standards, write/edit copy, and plan/coordinate events among other things.</p>

		<h3>Cool! Do you have any interests outside of design?</h3>
		<p>Every now and then, I try to stop and smell the roses because everyday life can feel stressful, mundane, etc. So I like to eat food that makes me dance, listen to songs that makes me full, and travel to places that makes me cry (of happiness!).</p>

		<h3>How can I contact you?</h3>
		<p>Send a message to <a href="mailto:hi@plna.xyz">hi@plna.xyz</a>. I usually reply within 3 business days, unless your message ends up in my spam folder or I have limited internet access.

			<h3>I’m sorry, what was your name? Helena?</h3>
			<p>Hey there! You know, for some reason, people often think I say “Helena,” but my name is Paulina. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

			<h3>Where are you from, and how’d you end up in California?</h3>
			<p>I’m from Louisiana, which is quite different from California as you can imagine. California was last on my list of places to move to, but I ended up moving here because 1) I wanted to challenge myself and 2) I had a better shot at working in the tech industry. </p>

			<h3>So are you in the tech industry now? If so, what do you do?</h3>
			<p>I started out as a graphic designer when I first moved to California, but now I focus on designing user interfaces and writing the copy associated with it. I enjoy working closely with other disciplines because what I learn from them makes me a better designer/employee/teammate. I also help maintain brand standards, manage projects, and coordinate events among other things.</p>

			<!-- When time allows, I also try to practice HTML/CSS + Javascript to help me design better products. -->

			<h3>Do you have any interests outside of design?</h3>
			<p>I like to eat food that makes me dance, listen to music that makes me full, and travel to places that makes me cry (of happiness!). Since traveling has been put on pause due to COVID-19, I split my time playing games, reading, and learning new (and simple) recipes.</p>

			<h3>How can I contact you?</h3>
			<p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:ppaulinanguyen@gmail.com">ppaulinanguyen at gmail.com</a>. I usually reply within 3 business days, unless your message ends up in my spam folder or I have limited internet access.</p>

Ole Kirk Kristiansen bought his first milling machine, and the company only made wooden toys (have you spotted the wooden duck?). In the second vignette, LEGO started molding plastic bricks in 1946. The third vignette is of a designer’s office to represent designers working on the amazing LEGO sets that we all are familiar with. Finally, in the fourth vignette, you can see a modern molding machine with a complicated tubing system in the background. That's where the raw materials “travel” to the big molding machines that make LEGO bricks.<br><br>Display all the vignettes together, or put them in different places, to share the story of LEGO!</p>

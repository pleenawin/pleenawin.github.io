			<p>As the 20 Days of BrickLink event draws to a close, we would like to thank you for following along in celebration of BrickLink’s 20th anniversary. Just a few weeks ago, Eliska Jezkova, Dan Jezek’s mother and former CEO of BrickLink, helped us kick off the event with a video message that reminded us of BrickLink’s rich and fascinating history. From there, we outlined what made a difference, where things are now, and what’s next for BrickLink.</p>

			<p>Throughout the 20 Days event, we highlighted distinguished members who played a vital role in bringing BrickLink and its features to where it is today. These members helped different aspects of the site – like the Catalog, Marketplace, and Studio – evolve, and their contributions are immeasurable. Their exceptional dedication to this community helped breathe life into BrickLink. They’ve welcomed new fans without hesitation, and because of that, BrickLink has become – and still is – the place to meet others who share the same passion. To view a list of the aforementioned members, please visit the “Spotlight” section of each week.</p>

			<p>In addition to highlighting members, we also wanted to add a bit of fun and friendly competition. We held weekly BrickLink Challenges and posted a scoreboard of the top 20 participants. Each challenge contained questions about anything related to BrickLink, sometimes referring to previous posts. The questions became tougher as the weeks went on. Week 1’s challenge had only 5 questions. But by Week 3, there were 20 questions, and you had to reference the Catalog! If you happened to miss the last three challenges, you have one more chance to participate in the very last BrickLink Challenge at the end of this post. Your placement on the scoreboard is determined by number of questions correct and then by elapsed time. Don’t worry, it’s only 10 questions this time!</p>

			<p>Other than BrickLink trivia, we launched a different kind of challenge with #SameMold. The #SameMold campaign had two goals. The first was to celebrate and better represent the diversity of our BrickLink community. And the second was to spread a positive message of equality and inclusiveness. We believe that success can come from positive change. This coming Monday, there will be a new post highlighting MOCs submitted to the #SameMold category in the Studio Gallery.</p>

			<p>One of the most impactful element of the 20 Days of BrickLink event was the stories you submitted. You took us down memory lane about how you came across BrickLink. You wrote about how you found friendship in another member that went beyond buying and selling bricks. You also described your hopes for the future of BrickLink. Over 150 stories illustrate these fond experiences you’ve had with BrickLink. Your stories warmed our hearts, captivated our spirits, and inspired others, like Eliska Jezkova, to join in and share their own perspective. If you haven’t already done so, we encourage you to visit the 20 Years of BrickLink Stories page to get a glimpse of how other members were impacted.</p>

			<p>Thank you for sharing your favorite BrickLink moments, participating in challenges, and simply celebrating BrickLink’s 20th anniversary with us. Whatever connects you to this platform, your BrickLink team remains dedicated to continuing the journey of being your preferred and valuable partner. We are enthusiastic to embark on a new chapter and hope to have your confidence and support for milestones to come.</p>

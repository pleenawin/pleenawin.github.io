		<h3>You can do anything your heart can imagine.</h3>
			<p>You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Just make a decision and let it go. This painting comes right out of your heart.</p>

		<p>A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Work that paint. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. There we go.</p>

		<h2>Startup Matchmaker</h2>
		<p>The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.</p>

		<p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Let your heart be your guide. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.</p>
